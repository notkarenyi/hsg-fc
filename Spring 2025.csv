Through the lens of technology and policymaking, we critically examine how marginalized communities navigate and challenge systems of exclusion, while also grappling with technology’s chaotic and dual role. Tech can serve as a powerful tool for empowerment—but it can equally reinforce existing inequities through algorithmic bias, digital divides, and exclusionary design. Together, we will unpack how intersecting identities impact opportunities, how technology both disrupts and perpetuates inequities, and how more inclusive, accountable policymaking can shape a future centered on justice and meaningful social change

Event 1 - Hands-On Activity: Making Potted Plants - LVEJO’s Semillas de Justicia Community Garden is a prime example of reclaiming contaminated land and transforming it into a thriving green space.Representatives from LVEJO will lead the potted plant activity, sharing their expertise in sustainable gardening techniques while discussing how urban agriculture can empower communities to reclaim land and promote food sovereignty.This activity could highlight how ancestral farming practices are preserved and passed on through such initiatives.

The discussion will also provide practical insights on how students can position themselves for success in this uncertain environment—whether by building cross-sectoral expertise, exploring alternative funding mechanisms, or leveraging policy and research skills in new ways.

From the U.S. withdrawal from the World Health Organization (WHO) to the shutdown of critical USAID programs under the Trump Administration, these changes have disrupted traditional career pathways and reshaped opportunities in global health policy, research, and implementation.

This panel discussion aims to help students navigate the uncertainties of global health careers in this evolving landscape. Featuring experts from global health organizations, policymakers, and academic leaders, the conversation will explore how funding streams, international collaborations, and policy priorities have shifted and what this means for students looking to build impactful careers in global health.

The in-person panel will feature two experts, one from the University of Chicago and another from a global health research/philanthropic organisation (possibly from RTI International or MacArthur Foundation). Panelists will discuss the challenges posed by shifting U.S. global health policies, the future of multilateral collaborations, and the emergence of new funding and employment opportunities in non-traditional spaces, including philanthropic organizations, think tanks, and regional health initiatives. The discussion will also provide practical insights on how students can position themselves for success in this uncertain environment—whether by building cross-sectoral expertise, exploring alternative funding mechanisms, or leveraging policy and research skills in new ways.

We're leaving it here for transparency and because it is something we may still want to pursue, but we understand that funding may not be provided a second time. We also note that Rich Delewsky, who initially coordinated with us for initial planning, is no longer the Unum advisor, which may complicate matters. We are also revising attendance down to account for revised expectations.)
Prof. Leila Brammer is a professor at the UChicago College who is director of the Parrhesia undergraduate program, providing students with the resources to have important conversations about vital topics in society and encouraging viewpoint diversity and civil debate. (See https://mag.uchicago.edu/law-policy-society/figure-speech) Prof. Brammer spoke at this year's Harris orientation, and the Office of Student Engagement and Belonging has expressed great interest in having her speak again.

Tech can serve as a powerful tool for empowerment—but it can equally reinforce existing inequities through algorithmic bias, digital divides, and exclusionary design. Together, we will unpack how intersecting identities impact opportunities, how technology both disrupts and perpetuates inequities, and how more inclusive, accountable policymaking can shape a future centered on justice and meaningful social change

This panel discussion aims to help students navigate the uncertainties of global health careers in this evolving landscape. Featuring experts from global health organizations, policymakers, and academic leaders, the conversation will explore how funding streams, international collaborations, and policy priorities have shifted and what this means for students looking to build impactful careers in global health.

The in-person panel will feature two experts, one from the University of Chicago and another from a global health research/philanthropic organisation (possibly from RTI International or MacArthur Foundation). Panelists will discuss the challenges posed by shifting U.S. global health policies, the future of multilateral collaborations, and the emergence of new funding and employment opportunities in non-traditional spaces, including philanthropic organizations, think tanks, and regional health initiatives. The discussion will also provide practical insights on how students can position themselves for success in this uncertain environment—whether by building cross-sectoral expertise, exploring alternative funding mechanisms, or leveraging policy and research skills in new ways.

We have already reached out to our current HSO advisor that, due to delays in the reimbursement process, we were unable to hold any events in the 2025 Winter Quarter though we got allocations from HSG.

In the 2024 Autumn Quarter, we used up all the allocated budget and successfully hosted valuable events. Following the rules, we also submitted reimbursement applications for the expenses incurred within one week of each event.

However, despite reaching out to our previous HSO advisor during the 2024 Autumn Quarter several times regarding the delay in the refund process, the actual processing did not begin until the middle of the Winter Quarter of 2025. Furthermore, some of the refund amounts have still not been reimbursed. (We are very grateful to our current HSO advisor, Erin, for processing the matter promptly this quarter.)

Given these circumstances, we determined that holding new events would be challenging, as additional financial issues might arise.

## Executive Summary

The Harris Student Government Finance Committee oversees an annual budget of about \$60,000, which is allocated to Harris Student Organizations by the Office of Student Engagement and Belonging. The purpose of this report is to provide budgetary transparency to the [1,419](https://info.harris.uchicago.edu/harris-by-the-numbers) students at the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago. The Finance Committee has no bearing on other student engagement-related expenses, such as the Harris Professional Development Fund.

The overall budget for `r quarter` was `r dollar_format()(sum(summarize(group_by(df,org),n=mean(totalreceived))["n"],na.rm=T))`.

In `r quarter`, HSG Finance Committee funded `r nrow(summarize(group_by(df,org),n=n()))` HSOs, which reported at least `r round(sum(summarize(group_by(df,org),n=mean(attendactual,na.rm=T))["n"],na.rm=T))` attendees across `r round(sum(summarize(group_by(df,org),n=mean(eventsactual,na.rm=T))["n"],na.rm=T))` events in their post-quarter reviews. 

Breakdowns by event type, item type, and organization are included in this transparency report. 

Funding criteria used in this round included:

* Collaboration with other HSOs or non-Harris organizations
* Speaker events and career events (prioritize events that are open to the broader Harris community)
* Diversity and inclusion (inviting speakers of color, speakers who are disabled or are women)
* How much non-HSG funding each HSO has access to (including rollover from previous quarters, non-Harris grants, or non-Harris RSO funding)
* Detailed, itemized documentation with regards to planned expenses and justification for why unusual expenses are necessary

Planned improvements for next quarter are included at the end of this document.

## Total Allocations

The minimum amount received by any HSO was \$`r min(summarize(group_by(df,org),totalreceived)["totalreceived"],na.rm=T)` and the maximum was \$`r max(summarize(group_by(df,org),totalreceived)["totalreceived"],na.rm=T)`.

## Funding Criteria

Organizations with large amounts of unexplained rollover received limited funding.

## Funding Outcomes

```{r, fig.height = 7}
planned_spending(quarter, caption = "Note: Gold=Planned, Maroon=Actual.\n Amounts spent may include both HSG allocations and external funding.\nTo improve readability, this graph only shows amounts up to $15,000.")

planned_attendance(quarter, caption = "Note: Gold=Planned, Maroon=Actual.\nMiPPS, PMPSA, SASPA, UPSA, and WiPP did not report attendance for Winter quarter events.\nFor readability, this graph only shows attendance up to 300.\nMost orgs saw higher attendance than anticipated.")

## Spending Breakdowns

```{r, fig.height = 7}
orgs_by_event_type(quarter, caption = "Only HSG funds are considered, no external funds.")
```

Notation:

* **Social**: e.g., retreats, happy hours, mixers, study hours, and alumni events
* **Speaker**: e.g., presentations, lunch \& learns, and panels, usually about policy topics
* **Community engagement**: e.g., volunteering and off-campus events
* **Promotion**: e.g., graphic design, and recruitment activities
* **Workshop**: e.g., career fairs and writing workshops

```{r, fig.height = 3}
spending_by_event_type(quarter, caption = "Only HSG funds are considered, no external funds.")
```

We allocated funds on an organizational level, not on an item-by-item basis. While we collected total actual spending for fall quarter per HSO, the following analyses are estimates based on the proportion of funding requests dedicated to each category. For example, if 38\% of requests by Asian Policy Forum related to their annual Southeast Asian cultural show. We would scale this proportion by the total amount awarded to estimate the amount that would have been spent on cultural events. In this analysis, we only considered funds allocated by HSG, not external grants or funds.

Notation:

* **Services**: e.g.,  bartending, space rental, transportation, event tickets, and food delivery
* **Gifts**: e.g.,  speaker honorariums, promotional merchandise, and raffle prizes
* **Reusable supplies**: e.g., board games and decorations
* **Non-reusable supplies**: e.g., utensils and firewood

## Funding Priorities

```{r, echo=F}
source("priorities.R")
```

The HSG Finance Committee conducted a survey in Winter 2025 to ask the Harris student populace what events they would like to prioritize funding. `r nrow(priorities)` students out of 1,419 total responded to the survey, for a response rate of `r round(nrow(priorities)/1419*100)`%.

## Conclusion and Future Improvements

Improvement goals for next quarter:

* Release a list of vendors and vendor information to promote knowledge sharing among HSOs.
* Expedite timelines by doing the following:
  * Gaining direct access to the email inbox so that HSG Finance Committee does not have to go through the Student Engagement & Belonging team to send email updates about application timelines
  * Making further technological improvements to collate applications as quickly as possible for review.
  * Planning ahead and doing dry runs with Student Engagement & Belonging to avoid technical delays in funding disbursal.
* Hosting office hours throughout the quarter so that HSOs can get their application questions answered before submitting.

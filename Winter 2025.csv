"6","Anticaste Policy Students Forum","speaker","refreshments","Caste perspectives of Indian Police System and Indian Justice System: Challenges and Global Perspectives","This event aims to provide a platform for practitioners and professionals to share critical insights and experiences from their work within the Indian Police System and Indian criminal justice system. The discussion will focus on key issues, particularly the treatment of accused individuals from marginalized caste backgrounds by police forces and Indian Judicial system. Speakers will shed light on the systemic biases and procedural challenges that disproportionately affect these marginalised communities.
A central theme will be how police forces and judicial system handle cases of atrocities and gender-based violence against marginalized women. Experts will discuss the barriers to effective redressal, including institutional limitations, socio-political pressures, and gaps in holistic legal frameworks in criminal justice system. The event will also delve into the broader challenges of pursuing justice in cases of caste and gender-based violence, with an emphasis on procedural delays and accountability deficits.
To enrich the dialogue, the event will also feature a comparative perspective of the criminal justice systems, highlighting parallels, contrasts, and lessons from global policy frameworks. This cross-national perspective will allow attendees to explore innovative approaches and potential pathways for reform in India.
By bringing together voices from the field, this event seeks to foster a nuanced understanding of systemic injustices while envisioning actionable strategies for policy and practice. Students, researchers, policymakers, and advocates are invited to join this thought-provoking conversation.

Featuring a keynote address by renowned scholar James Robinson, the event will include dynamic panel discussions with faculty, students, and practitioners on critical topics such as governance strategies, resource exploitation, sustainable development, and Africa’s positioning in global engagements. The discussions will explore how Africa can balance foreign interests with national development priorities, foster equitable partnerships, and ensure that African voices shape the continent’s future.

In collaboration with ACSA (African and Caribbean Students Association), East African Students Association (EASA), and Booth Africa, we will promote the event and leverage shared resources to ensure broad engagement and participation. Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the historical and current dimensions of international engagement with Africa and leave with actionable strategies to support sustainable and equitable development. The event will also create opportunities for building cross-disciplinary partnerships between academic institutions, policy organizations, and industry players, while showcasing diverse perspectives through the inclusion of African scholars, practitioners, and students.

By fostering critical dialogue on Africa’s global positioning and governance challenges, this event aims to inspire actionable solutions that prioritize Africa’s growth and empowerment.

Tech can serve as a powerful tool for empowerment—but it can equally reinforce existing inequities through algorithmic bias, digital divides, and exclusionary design. Together, we will unpack how intersecting identities impact opportunities, how technology both disrupts and perpetuates inequities, and how more inclusive, accountable policymaking can shape a future centered on justice and meaningful social change

We believe these events would go a long way towards setting out a framework for even the most novice or shy speakers to become more confident and become thought leaders in the Harris community.

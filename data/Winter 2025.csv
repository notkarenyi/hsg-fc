"6","Anticaste Policy Students Forum","workshop","refreshments","Caste perspectives of Indian Police System and Indian Justice System: Challenges and Global Perspectives","This event aims to provide a platform for practitioners and professionals to share critical insights and experiences from their work within the Indian Police System and Indian criminal justice system. The discussion will focus on key issues, particularly the treatment of accused individuals from marginalized caste backgrounds by police forces and Indian Judicial system. Speakers will shed light on the systemic biases and procedural challenges that disproportionately affect these marginalised communities.
A central theme will be how police forces and judicial system handle cases of atrocities and gender-based violence against marginalized women. Experts will discuss the barriers to effective redressal, including institutional limitations, socio-political pressures, and gaps in holistic legal frameworks in criminal justice system. The event will also delve into the broader challenges of pursuing justice in cases of caste and gender-based violence, with an emphasis on procedural delays and accountability deficits.
To enrich the dialogue, the event will also feature a comparative perspective of the criminal justice systems, highlighting parallels, contrasts, and lessons from global policy frameworks. This cross-national perspective will allow attendees to explore innovative approaches and potential pathways for reform in India.
By bringing together voices from the field, this event seeks to foster a nuanced understanding of systemic injustices while envisioning actionable strategies for policy and practice. Students, researchers, policymakers, and advocates are invited to join this thought-provoking conversation.

"855","OUTPolitik","speaker","miscellaneous","Queer identities in international development work","Queer people across the world face multiple challenges concerning living and working in developmental sector locations. Some countries criminalize homosexuality, and others socially disregard queer identities. The entirety of West, northern, and eastern Africa, in particular, have laws that criminalize homosexuality. This becomes particularly contentious for people in the policy landscape who want to work in these contexts but have to hide their true selves. We want to call a panel of speakers who identify as queer and work in a developmental landscape and understand the challenges they face while working in such nations and how they navigate these laws if a situation surfaces.
